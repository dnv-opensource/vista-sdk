# Vista SDK Python Benchmark Suite

This document describes the benchmark infrastructure and practices for the Vista SDK Python implementation.

## Overview

The benchmark suite tests various performance aspects of the SDK:

1. Performance benchmarks
2. Memory usage profiling
3. Concurrent operation tests
4. Load testing with large datasets

## Running Benchmarks

Benchmarks can be run using:

```bash
python run_benchmarks.py
```

Or using pytest directly:

```bash
pytest tests/benchmark/ --benchmark-only
```

## Benchmark Categories

### Performance Tests

Located in `test_benchmarks.py`, these measure:
- Path parsing speed
- Version conversion performance
- Data structure operations

### Memory Tests

Memory profiling tests in `test_benchmarks.py` measure:
- Memory usage with large datasets
- Memory leaks
- Resource cleanup

### Concurrency Tests

Tests in `test_concurrent.py` verify:
- Parallel operation performance
- Resource contention handling
- Thread safety

### Load Tests

Located in `test_load.py`, these verify:
- Large dataset handling
- Bulk operation performance
- System stability under load

## Continuous Benchmark Tracking

Benchmarks are tracked across commits using:
1. Benchmark results stored in `benchmark_results/`
2. Performance regression detection in CI/CD
3. Historical trend analysis

### Adding New Benchmarks

1. Create test file in `tests/benchmark/`
2. Add configuration to `benchmark.json`
3. Update documentation
4. Add baseline measurements

### Performance Regression Testing

The CI pipeline:
1. Runs benchmarks on each PR
2. Compares results to baselines
3. Flags significant regressions
4. Archives results for trending

## Best Practices

1. Include memory and CPU profiling
2. Test with realistic data sizes
3. Measure multiple iterations
4. Compare against baselines
5. Document performance requirements
6. Track historical trends

## Maintenance

Regular tasks:
1. Update baseline measurements
2. Clean old benchmark data
3. Review regression thresholds
4. Update test datasets
5. Verify resource cleanup
